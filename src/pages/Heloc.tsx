                Do you currently carry high interest revolving credit on credit cards, cars & other personal loans? 
                You may be able to leverage a home equity line of credit (HELOC) to lower your monthly debt payments. 
                Lenders typically allow borrowers to receive up to 80% of their home equity, though the precise LTV limit 
                will depend on broader market conditions, your credit score, and how valuable your customer relationship is to the bank.

              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                A HELOC for debt consolidation typically makes sense when: you have significant home equity, 
                your current debts carry high interest rates (especially credit cards), you need lower monthly payments 
                to improve cash flow, and you're disciplined enough not to run up new credit card balances after consolidating.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-display font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Risks to Consider</h3>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                Unlike credit cards and personal loans, a HELOC is secured by your home. If you can't make payments, 
                you risk foreclosure. Additionally, HELOCs typically have variable interest rates that can increase over time. 
                The longer repayment period means you may pay more total interest, even at a lower rate.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-display font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Tax Implications</h3>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                Prior to 2017, HELOC interest was tax deductible regardless of how funds were used. 
                Now, interest is only deductible if used for home improvements. If you're consolidating credit card debt, 
                set the tax rate to 0% in this calculator to get accurate results.
