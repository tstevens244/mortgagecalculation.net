                    The decision to rent or buy a home is one of the most significant financial choices you'll make. 
                    This calculator helps you compare the true costs of each option by considering multiple factors 
                    including monthly payments, appreciation, tax benefits, and transaction costs.

                  <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground mt-6">Key Factors to Consider</h3>
                  <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Time Horizon:</strong> Buying generally makes more sense if you plan to stay for 5+ years.</li>
                    <li><strong>Home Appreciation:</strong> Markets vary widely; research local trends carefully.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rent Increases:</strong> Consider how rent typically increases in your area annually.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transaction Costs:</strong> Selling a home typically costs 6-10% of the sale price.</li>
                    <li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Homeowners should budget 1-2% of home value annually for repairs.</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground mt-6">Tax Considerations</h3>
                  <p>
                    The mortgage interest deduction can provide significant tax benefits for homeowners who itemize. 
                    However, with the increased standard deduction, fewer taxpayers now benefit from itemizing. 
                    Enter your marginal tax rate only if you plan to itemize deductions.
